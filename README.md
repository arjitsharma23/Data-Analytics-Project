AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project
In the AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of hotel bookings data to extract valuable insights. The project involved multiple stages, including data import, exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insight generation.

1. Data Import and Exploration:

Imported data from five CSV files: dim_date.csv, dim_hotels.csv, dim_rooms.csv, fact_aggregated_bookings.csv, and fact_bookings.csv.
Explored data to understand its structure, identified unique values, and visualized booking platform distributions.
2. Data Cleaning:

Addressed invalid guest numbers by filtering out records with non-positive values.
Removed outliers in revenue data using statistical limits.
Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the aggregated bookings data.
3. Data Transformation:

Calculated occupancy percentages for each property.
Converted occupancy rates to percentage values and integrated room and hotel data to analyze average occupancy by room category, city, and date.
4. Insights Generation:

Merged datasets to analyze revenue by city and booking platform.
Generated insights into average revenue realized and occupancy rates across different room types and cities.
Compared performance between different booking platforms and cities to identify trends.
Applications in People Analytics and HR:

Data Integration: Combine various HR data sources to create comprehensive employee profiles and improve reporting accuracy.
Error Handling: Apply techniques for cleaning and validating data to maintain data integrity in HR systems.
Data Analysis: Analyze HR metrics (e.g., employee performance, engagement) to inform decision-making and strategic planning.
Visualization: Use data visualization to present HR insights clearly and effectively to stakeholders.
